# React journey

This project is part of my current goal of learning React and it ecosystem with Typescript after using VueJS 2 for production.

The project currently uses Redux Toolkit, Axios and Material UI with vite as the build tool.

I am also writing the backend for it using Laravel. Project can be found here **[EcomPortfo-backend](https://github.com/AnouarTouati/EcomPortfo-backend)**.
