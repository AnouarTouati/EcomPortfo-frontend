CORS is just pain to setup. I had to deal with it once at work to connect VueJS app to our backend i was so confused, I think it worked with a struck of luckðŸ˜…. But, recently I had to do it for my personal project to learn React and I made sure to know why things happen the way they do.
What I figured out is most articles/tutorials dont tell you that the browser is the one protecting you. Meaning, you make a get request from a non allowed origin the server with data + allow origin header set to false, then the browser will not serve the data to your frontend app. it is little bit different with post request. since the server will execute the code then reply it is dangerous to accept POST request directly that is why the browser send a pre-flight request to the server to ask if this operation/origin is allowed before sending the actual POST request
